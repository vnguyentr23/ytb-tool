# Assets Folder

This folder contains application assets:

## Required Files

- `icon.png` - Application icon (256x256 recommended)
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon file (for build)

You can create your own icons or use icon generators:

- https://www.icoconverter.com/
- https://favicon.io/

For now, the application will work without custom icons.
